GPT Tricks

Normally GPT writes faster code than use. Our understanding highly depends on how we are able to relate the domain object together and visiualize the relationship of those in our brain(I guess that's how we learn, there is a generation step in human brain to make sure that those relationship are memorized)

To learn faster, what you can do is ask GPT4 first to break the process down into steps. Then ask GPT to draw those domain objects involved, than the data flow between those domain objects to help us visiualize the relationships
